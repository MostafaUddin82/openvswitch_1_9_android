.SH NAME
ovs\-brcompatd \- Bridge compatibility front-end for ovs\-vswitchd
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ovs\-brcompatd
[\fIoptions\fR]
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
A daemon that provides a legacy bridge front-end for \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR.  It
does this by listening for bridge ioctl commands (e.g., those generated by
the \fBbrctl\fR program) to add or remove datapaths and the interfaces
that attach to them.
This feature is deprecated and will be removed no earlier than February 2013.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-\-appctl=\fIprogram\fR"
Sets the name to the program that \fBovs\-brcompatd\fR runs to
communicate with \fBovs\-vswitchd\fR.  The default is
\fBovs\-appctl\fR.  Unless \fIprogram\fR contains \fB/\fR,
\fBovs\-brcompatd\fR will search the \fBPATH\fR environment variable
to find it.
.
.IP "\fB\-\-vsctl=\fIprogram\fR"
Sets the name to the program that \fBovs\-brcompatd\fR runs to
communicate with \fBovsdb\-server\fR.  The default is
\fBovs\-vsctl\fR.  Unless \fIprogram\fR contains \fB/\fR,
\fBovs\-brcompatd\fR will search the \fBPATH\fR environment variable
to find it.
.
.ds DD
.TP
\fB\-\-pidfile\fR[\fB=\fIpidfile\fR]
Causes a file (by default, \fB\*(PN.pid\fR) to be created indicating
the PID of the running process.  If the \fIpidfile\fR argument is not
specified, or
if it does not begin with \fB/\fR, then it is created in
\fB/data/local/tmp/run/openvswitch\fR.
.IP
If \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, no pidfile is created.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is specified and the specified pidfile 
already exists and is locked by a running process, \fB\*(PN\fR refuses 
to start.  Specify \fB\-\-overwrite\-pidfile\fR to cause it to instead 
overwrite the pidfile.
.IP
When \fB\-\-pidfile\fR is not specified, this option has no effect.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-detach\fR
Causes \fB\*(PN\fR to detach itself from the foreground session and
run as a background process. \*(DD
.
.TP
\fB\-\-monitor\fR
Creates an additional process to monitor the \fB\*(PN\fR daemon.  If
the daemon dies due to a signal that indicates a programming error
(e.g. \fBSIGSEGV\fR, \fBSIGABRT\fR), then the monitor process starts a
new copy of it.  If the daemon die or exits for another reason, the
monitor process exits.
.IP
This option is normally used with \fB\-\-detach\fR, but it also
functions without it.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR
By default, when \fB\-\-detach\fR is specified, \fB\*(PN\fR 
changes its current working directory to the root directory after it 
detaches.  Otherwise, invoking \fB\*(PN\fR from a carelessly chosen 
directory would prevent the administrator from unmounting the file 
system that holds that directory.
.IP
Specifying \fB\-\-no\-chdir\fR suppresses this behavior, preventing
\fB\*(PN\fR from changing its current working directory.  This may be 
useful for collecting core files, since it is common behavior to write 
core dumps into the current working directory and the root directory 
is not a good directory to use.
.IP
This option has no effect when \fB\-\-detach\fR is not specified.

.IP "\fB\-v\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=\fR[\fIspec\fR]
.
Sets logging levels.  Without any \fIspec\fR, sets the log level for
every module and facility to \fBdbg\fR.  Otherwise, \fIspec\fR is a
list of words separated by spaces or commas or colons, up to one from
each category below:
.
.RS
.IP \(bu
A valid module name, as displayed by the \fBvlog/list\fR command on
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8), limits the log level change to the specified
module.
.
.IP \(bu
\fBsyslog\fR, \fBconsole\fR, or \fBfile\fR, to limit the log level
change to only to the system log, to the console, or to a file,
respectively.
.
.IP \(bu 
\fBoff\fR, \fBemer\fR, \fBerr\fR, \fBwarn\fR, \fBinfo\fR, or
\fBdbg\fR, to control the log level.  Messages of the given severity
or higher will be logged, and messages of lower severity will be
filtered out.  \fBoff\fR filters out all messages.  See
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a definition of each log level.
.RE
.
.IP
Case is not significant within \fIspec\fR.
.IP
Regardless of the log levels set for \fBfile\fR, logging to a file
will not take place unless \fB\-\-log\-file\fR is also specified (see
below).
.IP
For compatibility with older versions of OVS, \fBany\fR is accepted as
a word but has no effect.
.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose\fR"
Sets the maximum logging verbosity level, equivalent to
\fB\-\-verbose=dbg\fR.
.
.\" Python vlog doesn't implement -vPATTERN so only document it if
.\" \*(PY is empty:
.ie dPY
.el \{
.IP "\fB\-vPATTERN:\fIfacility\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-verbose=PATTERN:\fIfacility\fB:\fIpattern\fR"
Sets the log pattern for \fIfacility\fR to \fIpattern\fR.  Refer to
\fBovs\-appctl\fR(8) for a description of the valid syntax for \fIpattern\fR.
\}
.
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR[\fB=\fIfile\fR]
Enables logging to a file.  If \fIfile\fR is specified, then it is
used as the exact name for the log file.  The default log file name
used if \fIfile\fR is omitted is \fB/data/local/tmp/log/openvswitch/\*(PN.log\fR.

.IP "\fB\-h\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-help\fR"
Prints a brief help message to the console.

.IP "\fB\-V\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-version\fR"
Prints version information to the console.
.TP
\fB\-\-check\-leaks=\fIfile\fR
.
Logs information about memory allocation and deallocation to
\fIfile\fR, to allow for debugging memory leaks in \fB\*(PN\fR.  This
option slows down \fB\*(PN\fR considerably, so it should only be used
when a memory leak is suspected.  Use the \fBovs\-parse\-leaks\fR script
to interpret the leak file.
.TP
\fB\-\-leak\-limit=\fIsize\fR
.
Limits size of the leak file as specified by \fB\-\-check\-leaks\fR to 
\fIsize\fR bytes.  Finding leaks sometimes requires allowing the leak 
file to grow very large, up to 1GB.  By default, files are limited
to 10MB.
